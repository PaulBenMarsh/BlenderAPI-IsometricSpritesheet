# BlenderAPI-IsometricSpritesheet


A Python script which uses the Blender API to generate an isometric (technically dimetric) projection 2D spritesheet of a 3D animation.
For a walk cycle containing 24 frames, and 8 different viewing directions, this script will pan and orbit the orthographic camera around the origin of the scene at 360Â°/8 degree intervals, rendering the entire walk cycle once for each pass.
